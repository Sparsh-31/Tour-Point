        <h1>Goa Tourism and Travel Guide</h1>
        <p>Famous for its beaches, parties, Portuguese heritage and "Susegad" or relaxed lifestyle, Goa is the smallest state in India in terms of area. Where to go in Goa? When in India‚Äôs sunshine state, be prepared to fall in love with sandy beaches, palm-fringed shores and beachfront Portuguese bungalows. Goa will never fail to entice you with its landscapes peppered with paddy fields, coconut groves, windy cliffs and riverside forts. North or South Goa? While South Goa is a haven for tourists seeking quiet days spent by the tranquil seaside, North Goa is known primarily because of its bustling shacks and legendary nightlife. From the umpteen number of places to visit in Goa, a few that most definitely shouldn‚Äôt be missed are the Fontainhas ‚Äì India‚Äôs only existing Latin quarters, the 17th century old Bom Jesus Basilica; to revel in a little bohemian spirit, the vibrant Wednesday flea market at Anjuna Beach, and Dudhsagar ‚Äì one of India‚Äôs highest waterfalls. But if you‚Äôre here simply to unwind, there‚Äôs no dearth of things to enjoy. What to do in Goa? Starting with spotting a dolphin or two at the Palolem beach, marveling at the routinely glorious sunsets at Chapora fort, taking leisurely strolls through the mossy ruins of St. Augustine in Old Goa or simply soaking in the salty tropical breeze with platefuls of butter garlic prawns, bebinca and a few too many rum and cokes, with a side of jazz and Konkani music. Wondering how much a visit to Goa will cost you? Goa tourism has made it easier for all kinds of travellers with a daily budget between Rs.3000 to Rs.5000. If your budget is tighter, read on to see what Goa tourism offers to its budget travellers and also for a fair breakdown of your expenses in Goa.</p>

        <h1 style="margin-top: 50px;">Best Time to Visit Goa</h1>
        <p>November to February is the best time to visit Goa and explore Goa tourism if you want to enjoy the best part of Goa‚Äôs weather.

            Peak season is from mid-November to mid- February when the weather is comfortable, cool and pleasant. Shoulder season is from mid-June to October when Goa tourism is at its most beautiful. The rains come down on the state during these months and while the countryside becomes a lush green, the clubs start brimming with people and raging parties. Off-season is the time between March to May when the temperatures soar and the prices of the hotels and homestays drop. This is the time when Goa tourism is at a low and you may get some quiet days, away from the touristy crowds.
